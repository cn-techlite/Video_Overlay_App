# Video Overlay App

A project that is showing the continous looping of video with text overlay on it.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Flutter-based custom video player with an overlay text and hidden controls — similar to YouTube’s interaction style.

The video is displayed in a landscape ratio (16:9), centered on screen.

Overlay text (e.g. “Welcome to InfiniteSimul”) remains visible at all times.

Tap-to-toggle controls (progress indicator).

Smooth animations and adaptable layout for both portrait and landscape orientations.
