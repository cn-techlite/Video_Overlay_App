# Video Overlay App

- A project that is showing the continuous looping of video with text overlay on it.

- This project demonstrates a Flutter-based custom video player with an overlay text and hidden control


## Overview

Approach Explanation

The implementation is split into two main parts:

1. Controller (HomeScreenController)

Handles the lifecycle of VideoPlayerController.

Initializes the video (from network).


Manages play/pause and cleanup in dispose().

2. View (HomeScreenView)

Uses a OrientationBuilder to maintain a landscape-style aspect ratio (16:9) regardless of device orientation.

Builds a Stack containing:

Video player (with rounded corners and shadows).

Overlay text (always visible).

Hidden video controls (shown when tapped).

A state variable showControls (controlled via GestureDetector) toggles visibility of play/pause

Animations and opacity transitions are used for a smooth, modern feel.
